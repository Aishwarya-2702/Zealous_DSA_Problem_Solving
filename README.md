# Zealous Tech Corp Internship – Day 1

🚀 **Course Title**: Problem Statement with Data Structures  
📅 **Day**: 1  
🏢 **Company**: Zealous Tech Corp

## ✅ What I Learned Today
Today I worked on solving two real-world Java problems using basic data structures and control flow techniques.

### 1️⃣ Least Deposit Finder 💰

**🧩 Problem Statement**:  
Given a set of bank deposit values entered via tokens, the program finds the **least deposited amount** among them.

**📌 Concepts Used**:
- Java `Scanner` for input
- Loops and conditionals
- `Integer.MAX_VALUE` for initialization
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

### 2️⃣ Top Two Tax Payers 💼

**🧩 Problem Statement**:  
Among 10 income values, find the **first and second highest** tax payer amounts using only conditional logic.

**📌 Concepts Used**:
- Looping structure
- Tracking max values with `Integer.MIN_VALUE`
- Efficient one-pass logic
- Time Complexity: `O(n)`
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`

## 🖥️ How to Run the Programs

Make sure you have Java installed. Then:

```Terminal
javac least_deposit.java
java least_deposit.java

javac max_payers.java
java max_payers.java
